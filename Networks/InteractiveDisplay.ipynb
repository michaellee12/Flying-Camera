    "This notebook allows you to interact with the trained neural network by feeding in different spectral data for classification. When you scroll down, you can select from one of the existing reflectance spectra from the dropdown manual. Alternatively, when you select \"Make your own spectrum\" option, you can create your own spectrum by selecting random value and input that into the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the top row, the center panel gives the hyperspectral reflectance data as a graph, and the left panel gives the RGB reflectance data as the colour in a box. When you are in the \"Make your own spectrum\" mode, the right panel also allow you to customise your own reflectance data.\n",
    "The bottom row gives the classification from feeding the RBG or hyperspectral data into their corresponding neural network. The network's classification is signified by the classes with the highest confidence values. A tick (✓) is placed next to these classes for your convenience.\n",
